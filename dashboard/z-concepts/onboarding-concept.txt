onboarding page refactor
stop fucking with landingleft
make a new one thats similar, but doesnt have supabase auth

todo:
refactor so lhs of onboarding is static and rhs becomes a scroller
put navigation in lhs
fix the port to database

also make the lhs actually change colors, should be a quick fix i think
